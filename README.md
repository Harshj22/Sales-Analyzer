#  Sales-Analyzer

Sales-Analyzer is a Python-based **Data Analysis and Data Visualization project** developed using **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.  
This project analyzes sales data stored in a CSV file and generates meaningful insights and visualizations through a **menu-driven program**.

---

##  Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to:
- Analyze sales data using Python
- Perform data exploration and cleaning
- Apply statistical and mathematical operations
- Visualize sales trends and patterns
- Gain hands-on experience with real-world datasets
- Implement Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts

---

##  Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization
- **Seaborn** – Advanced and styled visualizations


---

##  Dataset Information

The dataset (`sales_data.csv`) contains sales-related information with the following columns:

- `Date`
- `Product`
- `Sales`
- `Region`
- `Profit`
- `Customer_Type`
- `Payment_Mode`

This dataset is used for demonstrating data analysis and visualization techniques.

##  Features

- Load sales data from a CSV file
- Explore dataset using head, tail, columns, and info
- Handle missing values
- Perform mathematical operations (sum, mean)
- Generate descriptive statistics
- Create multiple data visualizations:
  - Bar Plot
  - Line Plot
  - Scatter Plot
  - Pie Chart
  - Histogram
  - Stack Plot
- Save visualizations as image files
- Menu-driven user interface
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) implementation

##  Program Menu

1. Load Dataset
2. Explore Data
3. Perform DataFrame Operations
4. Handle Missing Data
5. Generate Descriptive Statistics
6. Data Visualization
7. Exit


## Visualization Details

Bar Plot – Sales comparison by region and payment mode

Line Plot – Sales trend over time

Scatter Plot – Relationship between sales and profit

Pie Chart – Sales distribution of sample products

Histogram – Frequency distribution of sales

Stack Plot – Stacked representation of sales values

All visualizations are saved as PNG image files.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
